# Souls - Wedding Invitation Portal
This is a custom-built, premium wedding invitation site designed to replace traditional invites with a modern digital experience. I focused on creating a clean, high-end interface that works perfectly across all devices while keeping the code lightweight and fast.

### Key Features
* **Custom UI Design:** A tailored aesthetic using a Gold and Dark theme to give a premium, VVIP feel.
* **Smart Navigation:** Smooth scroll logic built with JavaScript to ensure guests can navigate sections without page reloads.
* **Live RSVP Handling:** A functional form that collects guest details and attendance status in real-time.
* **Device Optimized:** Fully responsive layout that adjusts perfectly from large desktop monitors to mobile screens.
* **Clean Codebase:** Developed with a focus on maintainability, using organized CSS variables and modular JS.

### Why I Built This
Instead of using a generic website builder, I wanted to show how a simple landing page can be elevated through professional development. I handled everything from the initial layout design to the technical optimization, ensuring the site is both beautiful and functional.

### Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for a solid and accessible web foundation.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, smooth transitions, and advanced layout techniques.
* **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS for handling interactive elements and scroll behaviors.
* **Bootstrap 5:** Used for its reliable grid system to ensure 100% responsiveness.
